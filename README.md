## General Info

My Cousin's Wedding is a “Freeway” style 2D action game. Game development is done by using Canvas and by following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In My Cousin's Wedding, we are attending to our cousin's wedding. The purpose is to reach to the bride and groom without encountering any old relatives and of course avoiding their questions like "When will you get married?". But we should also give a gift to the bride and groom. So we don't forget to pick up the gold on our way there. Enjoy!
